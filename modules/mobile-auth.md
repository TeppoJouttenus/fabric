## Mobile Auth Services by Dalton Hubble

### Talk

The best mobile apps leverage remote services to store rich personalized data, perform secure transactions, sync accounts, and more. Fabric's single sign-on kits let your app access the Twitter and Digits APIs, but they can do more. In this talk, we'll discuss how Twitter and Digits can authenticate your app users to your backend, design a small Go auth service for a Twitter/Digits app, and use containers to deploy it.
