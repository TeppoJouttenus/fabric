## How Fabric Builds Fabric by Kristen Johnson and Sam Phillips

At Fabric, we take a customer-centered approach to our workflow, asking, 'what value are we delivering to customers this week?' This session will cover how we use a Flow process to address bottlenecks and keep features, improvements, and fixes flowing to customers.

You can follow along with the slides as you watch the talk.
