## A Week in the Life of a Fabric Developer by Brian Swift and Hemal Shah

### Talk

Want to build a mobile SDK? Just want to get insight into how the SDKs you use every day? The mobile app ecosystem is an international phenomenon. Developers need better tools now more than ever, and the number of third-party SDKs is also growing to meet the developer's needs. In this session, we’ll cover an overview of Fabric, deep dive into technical decisions we made, and present the learnings on developing an SDK for stability, testability, performance, overall footprint size, and, most importantly, exceptional ease of implementation.
