# Welcome

Did you miss the _Flight 2015_ developer conference? Haven't yet gotten around to watch the videos? Not sure where to start?

We wanted to make it easier for you to dig into the cool stuff about Fabric that was covered at Flight. So we put together this learning path as a playlist for you to get you started. The Fabric team was involved in a few different ways, check out what we have been up to and how you can put it to practice.

Cheers,  
The Fabric Team
